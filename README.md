fb-bookmarklet-friends
======================

When you're logged in into Facebook there is a Javascript-Array called: "InitialChatFriendsList"
This array lists your friends mysteriously after importance.
To see who is the most important you can execute this script on your Facebook-default page.
Do this either by removing the "javascript:"-tag and poste into the webdeveloper-console or just 
save the hole thing as the URL of a bookmark in your Browser.
Both ways work.

Requirements:
I only tested it with Chrome 24, but it should work with every browser.

Have fun :)
